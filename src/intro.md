# Learning X, for the nth time!

> An introduction to the software development for web developers.

Hi, [I'm a web developer](https://github.com/eswr) who wants to write good code and as a part of this process I'll write here about my learnings. **what**? As a developer, it is essential to have readablity in most used programming languages and writablity in your core programming language. Through a series of tasks that I think are nice to have items in my toolbelt, I aim to do just that.
